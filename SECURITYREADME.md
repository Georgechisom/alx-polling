# ALX Polly Security Audit Report

## Overview

This document presents the results of a security audit conducted on the ALX Polly polling application. The audit focused on identifying vulnerabilities, assessing their potential impact, and recommending mitigations to improve the application's security posture.

---

## Summary

ALX Polly is a modern polling application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase. While the application demonstrates solid use of contemporary web technologies, several security vulnerabilities were identified during the audit. Addressing these issues is critical to protect user data, maintain application integrity, and prevent unauthorized actions.

---

## Discovered Vulnerabilities

### 1. Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

- **Impact:** Unauthorized users may access, modify, or delete polls or votes belonging to other users by manipulating resource identifiers.
- **Affected Components:** API endpoints and server actions handling poll and vote management (e.g., `/app/lib/actions/`, `/app/(dashboard)/`).
- **Mitigation:** Implement strict authorization checks to ensure users can only access or modify resources they own. Validate user identity against resource ownership before performing any sensitive operation.

---

### 2. Insufficient Authentication Enforcement

- **Impact:** Unauthenticated users may be able to access protected routes or perform actions intended for authenticated users.
- **Affected Components:** Route protection logic in Next.js pages and API routes.
- **Mitigation:** Enforce authentication checks on all sensitive routes and server actions. Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page and prevent unauthorized API access.

---

### 3. Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Impact:** The application may be vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS) if user input is not properly validated or sanitized.
- **Affected Components:** Form handlers, database queries, and any component processing user input.
- **Mitigation:** Validate and sanitize all user input on both client and server sides. Use parameterized queries and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.

---

### 4. Inadequate Error Handling and Information Disclosure

- **Impact:** Detailed error messages may leak sensitive information about the application's internals, aiding attackers in crafting targeted attacks.
- **Affected Components:** API responses, server logs, and error pages.
- **Mitigation:** Return generic error messages to users and log detailed errors securely on the server. Avoid exposing stack traces or internal implementation details in client-facing responses.

---

### 5. Weak Session Management

- **Impact:** Poor session handling could allow session hijacking or fixation, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Affected Components:** Authentication/session management logic, cookie settings.
- **Mitigation:** Use secure, HTTP-only cookies with appropriate SameSite attributes. Implement session expiration and regeneration on sensitive actions (e.g., login).

---

### 6. Missing Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection

- **Impact:** Attackers may exploit authentication endpoints or voting mechanisms via brute force or automated attacks.
- **Affected Components:** Login, registration, and voting endpoints.
- **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms to prevent abuse. Use CAPTCHA or similar solutions where appropriate.

---

## Recommendations

- **Conduct regular security reviews** and penetration testing.
- **Keep dependencies up to date** and monitor for known vulnerabilities.
- **Educate developers** on secure coding practices and common web vulnerabilities.
- **Implement logging and monitoring** to detect and respond to suspicious activities.

---

## Conclusion

While ALX Polly provides a strong foundation for a modern polling application, addressing the identified vulnerabilities is essential to ensure user trust and application security. Prompt remediation of these issues, combined with ongoing security practices, will significantly enhance the application's resilience against attacks.
